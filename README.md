# 10X-Settings
Custom color theme, settings, and keybindings for the [10X Editor](https://10xeditor.com).

üé® Themes:
- ```QuadTone``` : A theme which limits the syntax highlighting tones (i.e. not a fruit salad bowl).
- ```QuadTone2``` : A theme refined theme which is designed for a focus/zen like mode. *(Preview screens below)*

‚å® Keybindings:

- ```[Ctrl] + [2] ``` : Open/close current file in pane to the right.
- ```[Ctrl] + [Shift] + [2]``` : Open/close the counterpart file to the current file in a pane to the right.
- ```[Ctrl] + [Shift] + [P]``` : Insert a preporcessed output of a currently selected macro call.

---

üßæ Python functions:

- ```DuplicatePreprocessedLine()``` : this will take a line from a C macro and write out the parsed line underneath. This helps with complex macros to see synax highlighting, arguments, and parenthsis balance.
- ```ToggleColumn2()``` : when in single-pane mode, this will open a second pane to the right with the current file.
- ```ToggleColumn2Header()``` : when in single-pane mode, this will open the counterpart file in a new pane to the right.

‚öôÔ∏è Settings:

The settings file includes various customizations, including the use of RobotoMono font, and a margin for single pane on my 4K+ 3:2 monitor.
Unfortunately, I haven't yet found a way to dymamically set the margin when a column width changes, such as when in dual-pane mode.

**Notes:** Both themes are not fully complete, as they are covering the features I use. Neither theme modifies the Workspace Tree (yet).
