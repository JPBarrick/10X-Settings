# 10X-Settings
Custom color themes for the [C programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)), misc. settings, Python scripts, and keybindings for the [10X Editor](https://10xeditor.com).
\- *Contributions are welcome to better support languages other than C.*

**BE SURE TO READ ALL OF THE INFO. BELOW.**

üé® Themes:
- ```QuadTone``` : A theme which limits the syntax highlighting tones (i.e. not a fruit salad bowl). Only tested with **.c**, **.h**, and **.py** files.
- ```QuadTone2``` : A more refined theme which is designed for a focus/zen like mode. Only tested with **.c**, **.h**, and **.py** files.. *(Preview screens below)*

‚å® Keybindings:

- ```[Ctrl] + [2] ``` : Open/close current file in pane to the right.
- ```[Ctrl] + [Shift] + [2]``` : Open/close the counterpart file to the current file in a pane to the right.
- ```[Ctrl] + [Shift] + [P]``` : Insert a preporcessed output of a currently selected macro call.

---

üßæ Python functions:

- ```DuplicatePreprocessedLine()``` : This will take a line from a C macro and write out the parsed line underneath. This helps with complex macros to see synax highlighting, arguments, and parenthsis balance.
- ```ToggleColumn2()``` : When in single-pane mode, this will open a second pane to the right with the current file.
- ```ToggleColumn2Header()``` : When in single-pane mode, this will open the counterpart file in a new pane to the right.

---

‚öôÔ∏è Settings:

The settings file includes various customizations, including the use of RobotoMono font, and a margin for single pane on my 4K+ 3:2 monitor.
Unfortunately, I haven't yet found a way to dymamically set the margin when a column width changes, such as when in dual-pane mode.

:floppy_disk: Installation *(be sure to backup your existing files first)*:

**Notes:** Both themes are not fully complete, as they are covering only the features I use. Contribution are welcome... just make a pull request for review. Neither theme modifies the Workspace Tree (yet). The colors and contrast I see will be different to what you see, because I use a custom color profile on my operating system.
